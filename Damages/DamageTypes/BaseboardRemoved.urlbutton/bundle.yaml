    en_us: Baseboard Removed
tooltip:
    en_us:  Baseboards are frequently removed during the drying process. We need to look for clues that they have been removed in the collage images and match them to the overview image. Many times there will be a different color paint where the baseboard was from the wall, or, there may be some minor caulking or peeling along where the baseboard was removed. Sometimes, you can see the baseboards in the overview image placed in a different location.
