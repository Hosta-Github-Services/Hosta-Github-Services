    en_us: Casing Damaged
tooltip:
    en_us:  Casings are the trim pieces that encase doors or windows. Door casings are frequently damaged when the water damage originates from the floor. It is common to see the bottoms of them damaged by water - or cut through during a flood cut.  Window casings are damaged less frequently, but can occur when the water damage originates from the ceiling and drips down the wall. These will occasionally be removed during the dry process or may remain stained. The  below image shows the door casing has been cut with the flood cut
