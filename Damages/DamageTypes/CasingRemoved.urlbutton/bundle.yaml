    en_us: Casing Removed
tooltip:
    en_us:  Many times when there is water damage to a home, the door or window casings may be removed when they are damaged by water by the water dry-out company. There will most often be visual clues that the casings have been removed, the most common would be paint lines that were around the casings. Occasionally, the casings will remain in the images somewhere else in the room. (the images below show door casings, window casings would look the same, just around a window, that damage is much less frequent)This image shows that casings have been removed from the door. We can see the different color paint lines and the casings (and baseboards) standing up in the corner of the room.
