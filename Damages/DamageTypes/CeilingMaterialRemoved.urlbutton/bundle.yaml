    en_us: Ceiling Material Removed
tooltip:
    en_us:  This label should be used when any material on the ceiling has been removed due to water damage. This damage type is not to be used in an unfinished space. Example an unfinished basement, attic or garage may have never had a finish layer like drywall on the ceiling, if there is no evidence of a finish layer (like drywall or ceiling tiles as examples) no damage label should be used. This can happen on either walls or ceilings.
