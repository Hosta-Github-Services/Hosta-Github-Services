    en_us: Crown Molding Removed
tooltip:
    en_us:  Occasionally crown moldings will be removed prior to the photo capture, it can be difficult to see if they have been removed. We want to look for signs of removal such as paint lines (image on the left) or contextual photos showing some of the crown molding remains (image on the right)
