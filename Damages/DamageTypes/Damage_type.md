#### Description

*  Baseboards can be damaged by water. We need to identify when the baseboards remain attached to the walls but will show signs of water damage. These damages can be difficult to see in overview images. It is important to review the collage images for closeups of the damage

###  Baseboard Removed

#### Description

*  Baseboards are frequently removed during the drying process. We need to look for clues that they have been removed in the collage images and match them to the overview image. Many times there will be a different color paint where the baseboard was from the wall, or, there may be some minor caulking or peeling along where the baseboard was removed. Sometimes, you can see the baseboards in the overview image placed in a different location.

###  Casing Damaged

#### Description

*  Casings are the trim pieces that encase doors or windows. Door casings are frequently damaged when the water damage originates from the floor. It is common to see the bottoms of them damaged by water - or cut through during a flood cut.  Window casings are damaged less frequently, but can occur when the water damage originates from the ceiling and drips down the wall. These will occasionally be removed during the dry process or may remain stained. The  below image shows the door casing has been cut with the flood cut

###  Casing Removed

#### Description

*  Many times when there is water damage to a home, the door or window casings may be removed when they are damaged by water by the water dry-out company. There will most often be visual clues that the casings have been removed, the most common would be paint lines that were around the casings. Occasionally, the casings will remain in the images somewhere else in the room. (the images below show door casings, window casings would look the same, just around a window, that damage is much less frequent)This image shows that casings have been removed from the door. We can see the different color paint lines and the casings (and baseboards) standing up in the corner of the room.

###  Ceiling Material Removed

#### Description

*  This label should be used when any material on the ceiling has been removed due to water damage. This damage type is not to be used in an unfinished space. Example an unfinished basement, attic or garage may have never had a finish layer like drywall on the ceiling, if there is no evidence of a finish layer (like drywall or ceiling tiles as examples) no damage label should be used. This can happen on either walls or ceilings.

The tackless strip is utilized to hold the carpet in place and is usually left in place after the carpet has been removed.This label is best to use when the entirety of the carpet is removed and only the tackless strip is left in place. This will allow us to understand what material was removed.

###  Wet

#### Description

*  The damage type wet can affect every surface of the building. When placing the label wet we want to ensure that there is either visible water, wetness or evidence that there is wet material in the structure. If we cannot see anything wet in the overview images, a good indication of a material being wet would be drying equipment placed around the room. This drying equipment is usually fans and dehumidifiers but other types of drying equipment may be present.
