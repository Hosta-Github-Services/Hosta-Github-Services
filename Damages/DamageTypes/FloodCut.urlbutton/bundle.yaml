    en_us: Flood Cut
tooltip:
    en_us:  A flood cut typically occurs when there is an abundance of water on the floor, this water will soak into the drywall and “wick” up - damaging the drywall and hindering the drying process. Flood cuts will begin from the floor and are commonly cut two or four feet up the wall. During the mitigation phase of the claim the mitigation company will remove drywall either around the perimeter of the room or just in specific areas that have had the most water damage. We will need the entirety of these flood cuts labeled in an image. Since these flood cuts can span multiple walls, it is unlikely that an entire flood cut can be seen in a single collage image - it is important to label the flood cuts on each wall that are visible in the overview image.Flood cut label should only be used when the damaged material is drywall
