tooltip:
    en_us:  The damage type wet can affect every surface of the building. When placing the label wet we want to ensure that there is either visible water, wetness or evidence that there is wet material in the structure. If we cannot see anything wet in the overview images, a good indication of a material being wet would be drying equipment placed around the room. This drying equipment is usually fans and dehumidifiers but other types of drying equipment may be present.
